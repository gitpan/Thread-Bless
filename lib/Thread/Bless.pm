=head1 NAME

Thread::Bless - make blessed objects thread-aware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thread::Bless;     # make objects of this class thread-aware

    use Thread::Bless      # for your own module
     destroy => 1,         # default: 0 = original thread only
     fixup   => 'subname', # default: undef = no special cloning
    ;

    sub new { bless {},shift } # bless now thread aware for selected modules

    Thread::Bless->destroy( 0|1 );       # set/adapt destroy setting
    $destroy = Thread::Bless->destroy;   # obtain setting

    Thread::Bless->fixup( \&fixup_sub ); # set/adapt fixup sub later
    Thread::Bless->fixup( undef );       # disable fixup sub
    $fixup = Thread::Bless->fixup;       # obtain setting

    use Thread::Bless (        # provide settings for other packages
     package => 'Foo',                       # Foo
      fixup => sub { 'Fixup for Foo' },      # destroy => 0 implied
     package => 'Bar',                       # Bar, destroy => 0, no fixup
     package => [qw(Baz Baz::Boo Baz::Bee)], # listed modules
      destroy => 1,                          # destroy also in threads
      fixup => 'Baz::fixup',                 # call this sub for fixup
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

This module adds two features to threads that are sorely missed by some.

The first feature is that the DESTROY method is called only on the object if
the object is destroyed in the thread it was created in.  This feature is
automatically activated when Thread::Bless is used.

The second feature is that an optional fixup method is called on the object
(automatically by Thread::Bless) just after the object is cloned (automatically
by Perl) when a thread is started.  This is needed if the object contains
(references to) data structures that are not automatically handled by Perl.

Both features can be switched on/off seperately at compile or runtime to
provide the utmost flexibility.

For external modules that need to be thread aware but aren't yet (most notably
the ones that cannot handle having DESTROY called when cloned versions are
destroyed in threads), you can also activate Thread::Bless on them.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

These are the class methods.

=head2 destroy

 Thread::Bless->destroy( 0 );        # call DESTROY on original only

 Thread::Bless->destroy( 1 );        # call DESTROY on all objects

 $destroy = Thread::Bless->destroy;  # return current setting

The input parameter recognizes the following values:

=over 2

=item original (0)

If the value B<0> is specified, then B<only> objects will have the DESTROY
method called on them in the thread in which they were created.  This is the
default setting.

=item all (1)

If the value B<1> is specified, then B<all> objects will have the DESTROY
method called on them when they are going out of scope.

=back

=head2 fixup

 Thread::Bless->fixup( undef );             # don't execute anything on cloning

 Thread::Bless->fixup( 'fixup' );           # call 'fixup' as an object method

 Thread::Bless->fixup( \&fixup );           # code reference is also ok

 $fixup = Thread::Bless->fixup;             # return current code reference

The "fixup" class method sets and returns the subroutine that will be executed
when an object of the class from which this class method is called.

=head2 initialize

 Thread::Bless->initialize;  # only needed in special cases

The "initialize" class method is needed B<only> in an environment where
modules are loaded at runtime with "require" or "eval" (such as the L<MOD_PERL>
environment).  It runs the initializations that are normally run automatically
in "normal" Perl environments.

=head1 ORDER OF LOADING

The Thread::Bless module installs its own version of the "bless" system
function.  Without that special version of "bless", it can not work.  This
means that the Thread::Bless module needs to be loaded B<before> any modules
that you want the special functionality of Thread::Bless to be applied to.

=head1 BUGS

None in the module itself (so far).  However, several Perl versions have
problems with cloned, weakened references (which are used by Thread::Bless
to keep record of the objects that need fixing up and/or destroying).  This
shows up as errors in the test-suite or lots of warnings being displayed.
Later versions of the Thread::Bless module may include XS code to circumvent
these problems for specific versions of Perl.

=over 2

=item Perl 5.8.0

Doesn't seem to handle weakened references at all: core dumps during the
test-suite with "Bizarre SvTYPE [80]" error.  It is not recommended to use
Thread::Bless on this version of Perl (yet).

=item Perl 5.8.1

Issues warnings whenever a thread is shut down, one for each package that
has Thread::Bless enabled on it:

 "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar during global destruction."

So far, this warning does not seem to affect further execution of Perl.  The
test-suite should complete without finding any errors.

=item Perl 5.8.2

Issues warnings whenever a thread is shut down, one for each package that
has Thread::Bless enabled on it:

 "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0xdeadbeef during global destruction."

So far, this warning does not seem to affect further execution of Perl.  The
test-suite should complete without finding any errors.

=back

=head1 MOD_PERL

This module's functioning depends on running the INIT {} subroutine
automatically when Perl starts executing.  However, this does B<not> happen
when running under mod_perl: the INIT state has passed long before this
module is loaded, see

 L<http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/porting.html#CHECK_And_INIT_Blocks>

for more information.  Therefore this module does not work correctly unless
you execute this special initialization check yourself.  This, fortunately,
is easy to do, by adding:

 Thread::Bless->initialize;

Executing the "initialize" class method is enough to do the initializations
that Thread::Bless needs (provided Thread::Bless was loaded B<before> any of
the modules to which it should apply its magic).  And to ensure full
compatibility with this and future versions of this module, Perl and mod_perl,
you can call this class method as many times as you want: only modules that
have not been initialized before, will be initialized when this class method
is executed.

=head1 TODO

Examples should be added.
