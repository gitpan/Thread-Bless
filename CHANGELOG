	Changed the INIT handler to a normal "initialize" subroutine, and
	have the INIT handler call that.  Made sure that the handler can be
	called seperately and multiple times.  Added some documentation in
	the MOD_PERL section indicating it is ok to call "initialize" as a
	class method as many times as you want.
